Data Leak Case Study â€” NIST AC-6

This repo contains a completed cybersecurity worksheet based on a data leak scenario involving excess folder access. It explores how poor enforcement of the least privilege principle led to unintended exposure, using NIST SP 800-53: AC-6 as the control reference.

 Objectives
- Analyze a data leak incident
- Apply NIST AC-6 to assess and improve access controls

Files
- `template-blank.docx`: Empty worksheet for reuse
- `worksheet-completed.docx`: Filled version with issue, review, and recommendations

 Key Takeaways
